Initial Project Structure:
  The project will be designed in a way that it will contain player folders. This means , that each player will get to create champions     
  withing the assigned folder. Of course , there will be an initial menu where the player will get to  choose the desired directory.
  Within each folder , there will be an initial JSON file , that will contain the player's Name,Age , Statistics concerning all the         
  progress that has been achieved so far and of course the each of the player's champion                                                     
  statistics(Class, Level, experience, HP ,MP, Physical attack, Magic attack, Physical defense, Magic defense, special effects).
  
  
  There will be a Menu on command line where there will be the following: 
    i) Choose Player 
   ii) Create Player 
  iii) Delete Player
   iv) Quit   
   
    Explanation
    
   i) To proceed, a folder with the Player's name must exist.If it does, the game will proceed to the "Main loop". Otherwise, 
   an error message will appear, leading back to the Main Menu.
  ii) User will have to provide some information about him , like the ones that have been mentioned in the first paragraph.
 iii) To proceed with deleting , the player will have to confirm some of the information he has given when he was creating the character.
  iv) Apparently , the user will be exiting the game by confirming this menu choice.
  
  
 After successfully accessing the desired player folder, the user will be redirected to the game's "Main loop". Here the choices will be 
 the following:
   i) Create champion
  ii) Delete champion
 iii) Statistics
  iv) View inventory
   v) Switch equipment 
  vi) Free Roam Battle
 vii) Dungeon exploration
viii) Switch player

	Explanation

(The user is directed to the champion creation screen , where the program will ask the following:
  i) Champion Name
 ii) Champion Class
iii) Champion Gender
NOTE : Later, I will be providing details about each class. In other words, each class  will have certain strong properties and weak ones. 
Moreover, each class will have a passive skill and a special effect , that will come in handy while battling. Additionally , each class will have skills that will be unlocked as the respective champion is leveling up.

To sum up, this screen will be having everything that a typical MMORPG has , and hopefully more nice features will be added.

GAME:

	The main game will occur when the player has chosen either choice vi) or vii) . These choices are likely to be merged on another sub menu , and they will be accessed through the "Battle" Choice that will replace them in the "Main loop's" menu
	For the purpose of battle , I have a bunch of ideas. For starters, on the Free Roam Battle , the players will be able to take the characters they created and kill monsters until they feel ready to explore a dungeon. This type of leveling 
	will exist for the sole purpose of leveling characters up to level 10. After passing this certain threshold, the players can access dungeons that will include monsters that are quite harder to kill. Experience gained in these dungeons will 
	be considerably increased. Up until now , I have thought of 3 to 4 dungeons. The first one can be accessed if the player has 2 or more champions greater than level 10. Same requirements will be applied for the rest of the dungeons.
	
	Bonus: 
	
	I've been thinking that the game will get to a better scale if I added a game window while the player is exploring a dungeon. The dungeon will be a small sized grid map and enemies will be all across it. The player's champion will be
	initially positioned on a spot that there aren't any monsters nearby. To defeat the monsters , the player will have to move the champions and will be able to engage in battle once being close to a monsters. Of course, with the monsters being 
	extremely strong , fighting just one of the separately will be quite a challenge.  
	
	As for the monsters, their appearance will depend on the champions' levels. In other words, each monster's level will rely on how strong the party is. For instance, if they player has chosen 3 champions ,each of them level 15 , the monsters' average level should be around 16 to 17.
	Of course, I'm intending to set the experience earned from monsters , depending on their level.
	
	The idea of making the game more visual will be implemented only once the game has been developed in a basic scale. Until this stage has been reached , the dungeons will still exist, but the way of battle will be more simplistic. For instance,
	once the player has entered the dungeon with the chosen champions , monsters will immediately approach and engage in battle. As a gamer myself , I wouldn't like to keep the game this way, as I know that this will actually get boring eventually.
